            <h4 class="mb-4">Design for a Outpatient Healthcare Environment</h4>
            <p>
                Patient rooms are critical spaces for residents, especially in long-term 
                care facilities. The increased desire for a sense of home and privacy, as 
                well as the social well-being of patients, calls for a more customized 
                design solution to the space. Since healthcare projects usually require 
                a large amount of capital investment, rigorous planning and regulation 
                compliance, and long project span, mock-ups during early design stages 
                have become an essential part of healthcare projects. They not only 
                minimize the risk and cost but also allow future users, medical staff, 
                and owners to experience and examine the space during the process. 
                Moreover, mock-ups provide a great opportunity for designers to have a 
                more intimate conversation with other core groups in the project team. 
                While mock-ups are usually designed and constructed by contractors, 
                designers benefit from strategic planning and fabricating mock-ups in house.

            <h4 class="mb-4">Outlining the Design Principles</h4>
            <p>
                Following the MGH radiology guidelines, our design strives to 
                “provide a sense of hominess and comfort in private areas and 
                creating assurance and calmness in diagnostic or clinical areas”.
                 Using architectural design features, we want to focus on the 
                 ceiling design because the patients are mostly on their back 
                 from preparation to MRI.
                We worked with consultants and engineers to develop a holistic 
                lighting experience. We researched on the compatible media display 
                devices and materials to make sure that the design meets clinical 
                standards and MRI safe. For this project, we introduced a new fabric 
                material to create ambient lighting.

            <P>
                We carried out a <span class="text-emphasize">two-month evaluation process</span>, during which we conducted <span class="text-emphasize">open house tours, dedicated user group workshop, design meetings</span> and collected feedback via questionnaires and sticky notes. We received 30 survey responses and more than 100 sticker note comments.
                Feedback analysis let us change several design features and enabled us to attain variance from the MAAB.
