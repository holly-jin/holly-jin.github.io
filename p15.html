                <h4 class="mb-4">Design for a long-term care facility</h4>
                <p>
                    Patient rooms are critical spaces for residents, especially in long-term 
                    care facilities. The increased desire for a sense of home and privacy, as 
                    well as the social well-being of patients, calls for a more customized 
                    design solution to the space. Since healthcare projects usually require 
                    a large amount of capital investment, rigorous planning and regulation 
                    compliance, and long project span, mock-ups during early design stages 
                    have become an essential part of healthcare projects. They not only 
                    minimize the risk and cost but also allow future users, medical staff, 
                    and owners to experience and examine the space during the process. 
                    Moreover, mock-ups provide a great opportunity for designers to have a 
                    more intimate conversation with other core groups in the project team. 
                    While mock-ups are usually designed and constructed by contractors, 
                    designers benefit from strategic planning and fabricating mock-ups in house.
                </p>
                <p class="p_larger mt-4">
                    Strategic planning is essential in ensuring the success of a mock-up. The team carefully considered the objectives and project schedule to decide the level of detail and evaluation methods.

                <P>
                    After discussion, the team decided the primary goals of the mock-up were: 
                    <ul>
                    <li>Evaluate the general layout the room</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the storage space for staff use and private storage</li>
                    <li>Examine the accessibility features of the bedroom and the bathroom</li>
                    <li>Assess the bathroom configuration</li>
                    <li>Collect feedback on the workflow and user experience of different core groups</li>
                    <li>Experiment with design changes by modifying the mock-up</li>
                    </ul>

                    We carried out a <span class="text-emphasize">two-month evaluation process</span>, during which we conducted <span class="text-emphasize">open house tours, dedicated user group workshop, design meetings</span> and collected feedback via questionnaires and sticky notes. We received 30 survey responses and more than 100 sticker note comments.
                    Feedback analysis let us change several design features and enabled us to attain variance from the MAAB.
