                    The goal of the pop-up food park project is re-design an empty lot in the Greater Grove Hall in Dorchester, MA.

                    Greater Grove Hall Main Streets is a non-profit organization which focuses on economic development, urban planning and community development of the greater Grove Hall area. Early 2019, 
                    we formed a team of 8 designers and partnered with the Greater Rove Hall Main Streets to think about creative solutions for utilizing empty lots and creating community space in the neighborhood.
                    Greater Grove Hall currently has 30% empty land. 

                    The Greater Grove Hall neighborhood has a significant number of empty lots. Seeing this as an opportunity for public placemaking, 
                    the Greater Grove Hall Main Streets proposed to turn empty lots into pop—up gathering place for food, music, and socializing. Residents and commuters could come to this lot on Fridays after work to get food from various food vendors, listen to music and socialize with friends and neighbors.
