                The goal of the pop-up food park project is re-design an empty lot 
                in the Greater Grove Hall in Dorchester, MA. Working with the 
                Greater Grove Hall Main Streets, which is a non-profit organization 
                which focuses on economic development, urban planning and community 
                development of the greater Grove Hall area, I co-led the team of eight 
                designers over one month to to create a scalable public gathering space 
                for the community accompanied by food, music, and activities.

                During the first meeting with the client, we discussed the overview and history of the neighborhood and came up with the key goals for this project.
