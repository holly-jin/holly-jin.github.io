                <p>
                    The evolution of the social housing in HK brings the 
                    collectivity to the individuality, eliminating the collective 
                    life in the public space in the social housing typology. 
                    From the the slab typology to the contemporary tower typology, 
                    the reduction in the collective life should be addressed and 
                    rethought about. The project aims to rethink about the collective 
                    life in the social housing in Hong Kong by reintroducing the 
                    inter-immediate scale of collective space in the housing types.

                By regulating the program sets needed for different sizes of apartments, 
                I am able to have flexible unit configurations and re-categorize the 
                unit types based on the depth of the units. There are three unit/corridor 
                typologies. The “N” type means niche, which creates internal courtyard 
                condition. The “O” type means open pocket, which replaces the unit and 
                links the interior and exterior. The “P” type means public balcony, 
                which creates shared collective space. The table shows the samples of 
                stacking various types of  “O”, “N”, and “P”. From the table, I chose 
                six types of stacking that have different collective and private space 
                configuration. The six basic samples of ½ wing length, 10 floors are 
                used as the aggregation unit. In this table, I set up the criteria by 
                measuring the (1) public balcony (2) internal courtyard and (3) scale 
                of the community they creates. From left to right, the gradient shows 
                the most collective type to the most private type. The bottom row shows 
                the scale of the community created by the shared public balcony. 
                In this way, the set of aggregations also reflect their scale of community 
                on the elevation expression.

            <P>
                Using those building sets, and the network language, the site strategy is to form courtyard of different scales based on the length and width already set up by the building scale. First, set up the ½ wing length (45m) interval x-axis field to prepare for the y-axis cut to form courtyards. There are three major flows for road and circulation in the y-axis, which naturally breaks the site into 2 groups. Tower fills in between the courtyards formed by the slabs to increase density.

                We carried out a <span class="text-emphasize">two-month evaluation process</span>, during which we conducted <span class="text-emphasize">open house tours, dedicated user group workshop, design meetings</span> and collected feedback via questionnaires and sticky notes. We received 30 survey responses and more than 100 sticker note comments.
                Feedback analysis let us change several design features and enabled us to attain variance from the MAAB.
